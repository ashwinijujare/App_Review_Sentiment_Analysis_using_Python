Does absolutely nothing for a LinkedIn beginner.. Force closes too.. Useless app,1
Force close(galaxy tab),1
Slow and it tries to upload your contacts without asking WTF?,1
Add ability to customize the profile and move to SD card and the app will be a 5 star one!,4
"Good app, but it's a pain that it's not possible to see your sent messages, it kind of confusing if your message was sent out at all!",4
This app is poor and bad. Linkedin app on my HTC Desire is bugged :(,1
Finally,5
"Have been using DroidIn. Ability to move to SD card would get 5 star rating. Thank you! Kyle, Evo",4
Works fine on Samsung Captivate.,4
Clean design with limited features. How about adding invites by email or address book integration?,3
App works fine but has limited functionality. I'm uninstalling until it has more features like group access.,3
Piece of s**t app. Really? You want people to use this?,1
Simple. Basic. But works perfectly for main functions. Fast. Stable.,3
though you do have to pay,1
Lame. May try it again later when it has more features. Sync unnecessary and drains battery.,1
"Nothing special comparing to web. Please, enable Install-2-sdcard",2
This is a very good start toward emulating the program on Android. I haven't experienced any problems with the program at all. Mighty fine jam fellows,5

Freezes and crashes everyone I try to use it. Xperia Arc,1
Good app for keeping track of contacts on the fly. I use regularly to send messages and Would be great if group functions were included.,4
WTF is the point in this app? Bring 50% functionality of the web version and it will be 100% better. Sort it out!!!!! Nexus S :-(,1
Perfect except there is no widget functionality.,4
Ok for basic linkedin functionality on the move. For all the features use the mobile site.,3

Creates ease of process and helps me provide timely feedback and/or questions to my member groups.,4
Liked it,4
Takes ages to login. Lacks all features. But a good beginning.,2
Slowwwww,2

Cannot even sign in- Galaxy ace,1
Great update sameer. Kep improving. Needs fancy UI now. 3D pls,5

Sent random invites which you can't delete in app. Uninstalling,2
Works very well on my Desire HD,4

Good app but need the ability to access group pages. Droid X,4
"Horribly slow, took minutes to load the main menu after login and got tired of waiting for the content pages. Galaxy S on a 100mb wifi.",1

"Doesn't work on my Galaxy S2. Sits trying to receive updates before crashing with a ""no internet connection"" message. Uninstalled and not happy!",1
Obviously you're not listening to your users. It won't let you edit your profile. POOR,1
"Good connectivity, lack of groups is a pain sometimes though.",4
Let me edit my profile,2
Slow to load and not much other than a viewing platform. Can take 15-20mins to open. Easier to go straight to website. HTC Desire,2
The lack of group discussions is a disappointment.,3
Droid is much better.,1
I changed my password but it won't register in the app. Keeps saying password incorrect,2
"Takes way too long to load. I don't know what it is loading (for the home screen), but it takes so long I closed the app.",1
Cant edit profile poor interface vs other social media apps,3
It sucks not upto the level,2

Can't see groups and their updates.,3
"Just loads forever, even on WiFi. Can't contact developer. Evo 2.2",1
Very limited app. Can't view forum posts. UNISTALL. how in hell did their stock go up so high? Not worth a penny. This is a piece of sh** app HTC Evo,1

This app is really slow to load and often locks up my phone.,2
Insta FC. UNINSTALL!,1
Plain doesn't work. Freezes logging in.,1
Doesn't work on 3G. Need to setup profile in a browser. Galaxy tab.,1
"Works fine on the HTC Desire HD handset, however the application basic and weak in functionality",3
good application works on videocon v7500... should have functionality to edit the profile...,3
"Great! Evo, cmod7",5
Good app. Ability to delete connections is requested. Thanks,4
Excellent,5
Would be perfect if you could edit profile. Good app though.,5
"Password stored unencrypted? No thx, uninstall.",4
No groups? Most of my traffic is on groups.... and the storage of passwords in the clear is unforgiveable... amateur hour.,1
Does what it says in the description.,4
Does the basics but could really use more features to make it more usable.,3
"It's good for the basic stuff. Messages, invites and your current connections. No functions to edit your profile data.",3
"On my Asus Transformer, the text in the login screen username and password fields is white on white. The foreground color is just barely brighter than the background. Uninstalling because of plain-text password.",2
"It's sucks, I even can't edit my profile or change my basic information",1
Does not work. Clunky. Rubbish.,1
Nicely done.,5
Indispensable,5
Would be good if app allowed to change profile..,4
Slowest app I've ever seen. Open it up and wait literally minutes before anything happens. Completely useless.,1
"There is no way to go to groups. For me, I have groups that are important. Until this is fixed, I uninstalled and created internet bookmark.",2
"Good idea, but it hangs up for ages on my desire",2
So very slow...,3
Ok probably needsmore work. Home screen does not auto rotate though content screens do and links from contct status can be flaky. v2.2 Dell Streak,3
Need to be movable to SD card. Also need more improvements.,2
Takes forever to load on my EVO Shift. I uninstalled it.,1
Need ability to edit profile from app 5* if updated to do so,3
No widget... What's the use?,3
Could not see how this was better than just opening the website. No integration that I could see.,2
Can't move to SD card = no place on my phone,2
"Can't see sent msg, profile visit, etc. It looks like just demo version...",2
Excellent interface.... Would have liked an options tab to manage preferences...,4
The interface is nice but it loads really slowly for every page. DX,3
Much too slow to be any use.,1
Way too slow to load each page. What's the point if you can't access info on the fly. Please fix the performance of the app. I've uninstalled it,1
Why so slow?? Faster to just access the website.,1
Doesn't respond at all. Horrible.,1
Very slow! Never loads!,1
Doesn't have a place for requests to me.,3
No sync config options. Drains battery. Can't edit profile. doesn't sync contacts to address book. Worthless. Uninstalled.,1
A bit slow and it does not do much. Droidin seems to work better.,3
Doesn't work at all and very slow,3
I'd expect atleast having an option to update current profile n skills,2
"Force closes, wont let me even open.",1
Need to update a lot...no groups..,3
Loads damn slow... Uninstalling... Desire s,2
"Can't see my groups, which for me is the main reason for using LinkedIn.",2
I can't even access my groups let alone comment!!,1
"No app2sd enabled, so being deinstalled.",1
"Nice app, but too slow",3
I really wish I could edit my profile from this app... :c,3
Nice looking app...when I can get to any screens besides the home one loading. Slowest app I've ever used even with wifi on.,3
Still has a way to go.,1
Can't be installed to SD card.,3
Nice app for the basics but I cannot access any of my groups from it.,3
Hangs everytime after update....please fix immediately,3
Decent app but very buggy and loses connection a lot even when I have 4g.,3
Linkedin needs to listen to what people want,2
It just logs in and does nothing!,1
Please update. Passwords cannot be in the clear.,5
Doesn't really do anything.,1
Very limited. Can't update profile from app.,2
Receive an error message each time I try to view my connections. DROID X,1
new version broken. Testing?,1
Must for any professional,4
App is missing the ability to monitor & manage groups. That missing capability reduces the overall usefulness of the app. It would taste higher.,2
Useless w/o group,1
Errors out every time on Nexus S,1
Was ok but latest update won't even allow app to launch - constant crash on Desire.,1
New version asks for access to contacts data? No thanks. Don't want another app importing private data. IPO needs to make more $$$ ?,3
Nice app. Only Miss the ability to interact with groups,4
"After upgrade, it stopped working. Try clear the old data from setting>application>manage application > linkedin> clear data. Then it will work.",5
Better now...,3
Terribly slow. Often fails to connect and as a result unusable on Galaxy S.,1
About time....,3
A group view would be a very useful update,4
Works,4
"Basically it sits there refreshing for ages at times without letting you do anything at all. Needs work, looks good, but pretty poor at the moment..",4
Absolutelly POOR implementation . Phone goes to sleep three times before anything happens with the App. Considering throwing out.,1
Works now,3
Not useable since update 20/06/11 HTC Desire using Droidin,1
Keeps hanging when refreshing pages. HTC Desire HD,1
Works better now updating connections.,4
"Constantly closed, unable to use, please verify the app. Using Milestone A893",1

"Used to work great, since the update - It's a tired, slow moving dog!",1

Keeps shutting down. DROID X,1
Best,5
Won't load any changes.,1

"Was half decent, but can't even open app since update.",1
Latest update is completely broken.,1

Use to be good for Android. Now takes forever to load.,1
"Simple interface, gets the job done. Add a horizontal mode to the main screen and you'll be golden in my opinion.",3
"Same issues most people are having, latest update makes up unusable, sends error report. Do you have a 3rd grader programming for you?",1
"HTC Desire HD, still out working after update, none of the buttons work..",2
Not working at all after the latest update. @Nexus1.,1
"Great for keeping up, but doesn't replace pc",4
"No option for updating profile, neither for adding recommendations. Can't rate it more ryt now.",2
New version is much slower to startup as out syncs the your data. Disappointing.,2
Rarely works and force closes,1
Basic but good. Needs a widget. Droidin has a few better features.,4
"App is super buggy on Xoom with Honeycomb 3.1. On the plus side, current version leaves lots of room for the developers to make improvements. ;-)",3
Interface needs updated.,3
After the update it keep crashing the app,1

"Works OK, but it's slow, a memory hog (no SD), and you can't share links from other apps. Droidin works better.",3
So slow better off using 3rd party app. Shame,1

Latest update not working on my HTC Hero!,2
Better honeycomb support required,4
Fc on desire hd 2.2,1
Broken after last update...,1
Does not open at all since the last two updates were downloaded. I am using Sprint's HTC EVO.,1
"Before(1.0.2) it was working well, please fix it",3

It keeps crashing all the time after i updated it,1
Ok app. Nothing special.,3
Doesn't work since latest upgrade installed.,1
Unbelievably slow - to the point that I'm not sure if it does anything at all. I'm amazed that this is such a turd.,1
Linked's app is simply fantastic. 5 stars,5
Decent when it works. Since latest update just cannot connect error message,3
Last update broke it completely.,1
For a professional app this is very poor on many fronts. Weak support updates are few and far between you have to wonder if this company cares,1
"Great, I like it better on my phone than on my computer. I use an EVO 4G and don't have any problems with this app.",4
Crashes most of the time and when it does open it seems to crawl and barely manages to open any of the updates. The worst professional app.,1
"Takes so long to refresh, even on wifi, that it's unusable.",1

Works great on my thc thunderbolt,5
"Like that they tried to make or user friendly, but it needs to pull updates faster. I get bored waiting for it to update and just back out. -sensation",3
Was working perfectly until the last update now it doesn't work at all! Tried uninstall & re-install to no avail. If linkedin's developers fix that 5*,2
I love this app.it will help me expand my world!!,5
Crashes every time on startup since i upgraded. Samsung intercept.,1
Useless. Serves no purpose. Trying to be twitter instead of a way to update and manage profile and network.,1
It worked fine in the beginning. After the update it died on Droid X.,1
Update won't download data and crashes. Was 3* until update. Missing 2* because of limited features: ie: reply (don't accept) & can't view sent msg.,1
Used to work...now it is nothing but a screensaver... completely dead - DROID X,1
Application Crashes on Motorola Milestone SDK Version: 2.1 Update 1,1

"Stopped working, Galaxy Tab",1
Doesn't login,1
Rubbish. Won't authenticate. Uninstalled.,1
Doesn't even load correctly on samsung vibrant for tmobile. Errors on every function. Uninstalling now!,1
Works perfectly.,4
Doesn't load at all even when connected to WiFi. Uninstalling.,1
"Pointless, not enough functionality, having to sign in every time I use it, unlike the website, makes using it a pain. Uninstalled",1

I have to log in every time. Not having the coice suchs. No groups ether,3
Doesn't update to show messages or connect requests. Frustratingly slow to start up. IPhone version was far better. Step up team. HTC desire s,3
"V slow updating, no access from email updates to app. No access to groups",3
Review for app only not LinkedIn in general. This app is slow to load to the point of near uselessness. I will not delete but wait for update to use.,1
Either sync is painfully slow or app is broken on Droid Incredible,1
Does its job. Worthy substitute to desktop version.,5
It works without crashing but would like to see groups and the group discussions.,4
Very slow.,2
Keeps crashing on MT4G TMO,1
Love it for my HTC sensation.,5
It would be nice if I can move this app to the SD Card.,3
"If LinkedIn doesn't add ""groups"" to this app fast, then they will be losing people to Google+ when public availability rolls out >:|",2
Good update!,5
"Crashes all the time, when it doesn't it keeps loading and touch actions don't work, ..",1
Many mobile sites are void if all the features and functionality that one looks forward to with an app but not this app,5
"Old version was nice and clean, uncomplicated, simple. This new redesign is overly busy, bloated and slow. Ridiculous animation, unwanted news strip.",1
Much improved from previous vers. New UI is nice. Still needs app2sd.,3
Not my contact data!,1
Outstanding UI.,5
"One 3rd of the screen is now a massive header advertising articles, linkedin isn't used for reading articles...",1
Really hate this update. Like old interface better. App just looks cheesy. Hate the ads on top as well.,2
NICE!,5
"Well done, this is a very nice update!",4
Great new UI (2.0)! Sync with contacts is also very nice.,4
"I just updated my LinkedIn app and I think that it is a great app. I like the new ""fancy"" UI.",5
The new app is perfect.,5
"Although the contacts sync with my evo, they don't include the profile pic or their status update like ConnectIn does. Currently run both and link.",3
Been waiting for these new funtionalities. Great update !!!,5
Love the new UI and glad to finally have contact integration,5
This ver is really slow and new UI is ever confusing. Disappointed.,2
What an awesome surprise from LinkedIn. Beyond expectations!,5
"Great new update, love it.",5
"Has features we expect-contact integration, groups, updates, news.",4
Very nice!!!,5
This sucks,1
Please add profile modification option.,5
Loving the updated version. Swoosh.,4
Much faster than the previous versions.love the new interface.,4
Much nicer than the previous version,4
"New interface is nice. Faster as well. ""Share update to twitter"" is removed, apparently ...",4
I've added a new star because of the recent updates. I would like to see the app open up when I get my email update.,4
The new look on versiom 2.0.0 is awesome! It's getting better and better!,5
"Asking for too many rights, I don't trust this. De-installing!",1
So far a lot like about LinkedIn 2.0 for Android. Could use a 'settings' option for sync/updates.,5
Better than ordinary resume,5
"Update offers more functionality, not that intuitive and the refresh can be slow",4
Very nice update from previous version. Wonderful.,5
"They have no business accessing my contacts. If I want them to access a particular contact, fine but they cannot have unfettered control.",1
Very nice update. Keeps getting better.,4
Don't like new layout and the app just completely froze my phone (GS2) ....this has not happened before in 3 months of owning it,1
"Appears to have security issues - showed me somebody else's groups and ""people you may know"". Uninstalled and reverted to earlier version!",1
"The new update is a poor effort. Non-intuitive UI, wants to sync all your contacts (at least it asked first & clearly), no clear settings section.",2
SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWW,2
Does not load.,3
I can log into my account online but not through the app.,1
"Don't like the new format. Too difficult to use, too many clicks, trying to be a news service, instead of sticking with what best at: biz networking.",2
New ui its step backward.,2
Love the new update and interface.,5
"Cluttered, poorly designed ui. Hate it!",1
Well I am glad to see groups finally included..however are there no notifications???? Can't see to figure out where I would set my preferences for notifications. It is useless to me with out notifications. Until this is cleared up I am going to continue using Droidin.,1
This update is much closer to the site.,5
This update is amazing. The interface is fantastic! Thanks!!,5
Force closes everytime! HTC HERO SPRINT,3
The new update is a game changer. Now I no longer need to install alternatives for linkedin.,4
I repeatedly get a Force Close error message even when I'm not even using the app. Annoying on my Droid x.,1
Wow I quickly browsed through the app and totally impressed with the new usability and quick info access.,5
Brilliant improvement. Waiting to see what you do in the next update :-),4
No Apps2sd? Uninstalled till its added.,2
Okay,3
"The new LinkedIn App is fabulous full of functionality including Groups, initial App was shockingly bad. Th enew improved App meets my high expectations.",5
Simply fantastic after update!,5
This is an awesome app & something I can really see myself using. Super nice job!,5
"New version does not go beyond the sign in page if the ""phone state and identity"" permission is not granted on a rooted phone.",1
Excellent!!,5
Really needs a Widget ! No profile editing option also.sad!,1
Excellent update. Contact sync was a much needed feature.,5
Version 2.0 works great on EVO 4G.,5
App store and market place go tell me to update if I click update on one service the other does not recognized that it wad updated and they fight back,5
Esssyons thanks for the well wishes and support. R/Jim,4
The latest update sucks. If you have an earlier version stick with it.,2
"Updates just hang, linkedin not available",1
"So much better! Love this version of the app, previous version was unusable, this one is a must have!",4
Wish there was a way to switch between my 2 different LinkedIn accounts.,3
Version 2 is a nice update.,4
New version alot better,4
Very slow. Needs app2sd,4
great,5
Sleek UI,5
Contacts Sync is a 5 star must-have!,5
Love the new interface. It is easy to navigate and a real joy to use.,5
Nice new interface but needs ability to edit profile and also be movable to SD to be 5 star.,4
Update. Great new version. Finally have access to groups!,4
Would like the ability to edit profile.,4
New version is very good,5
I have not been successful posting a new group discussion,4
All good,5
Latest version is great! Seems like a real social network finally and even includes relevant news stories.,5
Working fine now after rebooting the phone. Very slick,4
No SD?,3
Great updatr,5
Pls add some more features to this. A sent option would be nice. Also add a frequency for updates and notifications.,3
It's getting better. Keep upgrading.,5
Nice interface and overall performance is better,5
Need facility to move to SD,3
Really Impressive !!!!!,5
Avoid version 2! Everything that was good is now ruined.,1
Much faster now.,4
Would give it 5 stars if I could update my profile. Please add.,4
It was a much better app before the layout changes,2
Good style for the new version!,4
Like the UI and etc. But it is draining my battery after installing!,3
The new LinkedIn app is really nice! Congrats!,4
Great update! This now wants me use the app and keep myself updated! Love the updates and little things with UI.,5
Would give 5 stars if I could update my profile. But still much better than the last version,4
Can't even log in after the update!,1
"The new update doesnt has menu pending invitation? The previous version is better than the new one. Sorry, we need simple user interface",2
Great effort in rewriting it. You have to focus on adding all features the web version gives us.,4
"Good app, but out needs to save login information. Would also like it to allow editing my profile.",4
Works after updating to 2.0.1.,4
"Normally, I would give this app at least 4 stars but since the update it's not working. It's on an endless loading cycle when you select a connection",2
Funutation likes,5
Good program rewrite is excellent. works great on the HTC Desire,4
I actually use Linked In more.,4
Who has viewed my profile?,4
Why would they need to modify secure settings or delete other applications data? Not downloading.,1
The app may be nice but I don't like the fact it asks for permissions to change system settings and want access to my phonebook... Uninstalled.,2
"It asks for permission to your phone book because it either finds your LinkedIn contacts from your phone, or it adds them to your contacts.",4
What happened to the option of posting to my twitter acct? The UI nice though...,3
App is Gud bt need a feature of notifications whn v Gt msgs from our contacts.,3
good,5
"After the update to the new interface it stopped synching on HTC Sensation. Logs on, but no updates. Now uninstalling.",1
Excellent,5
"Awesome update, keep it up",5
Excellent,5
Not a fan of the new UI,3
"This latest release of the application (2.0) is not only beautiful, but smooth, fast and easy to navigate. It is also feature rich and highly useful.",5
Take a great idea and douche it up...,1
Why does this app all of a sudden need to know my phone state and identity? Along with the calls? I'm tired of the privacy trade off. Period.,2
"I don't want to merge my LinkedIn contacts with my phone, and don't want it to access my phone contacts. Does the update give choice?",1
Much much improved. Needs an on screen go back button in each view. News reader needs more improvement and cap on number of items. Htc Tattoo on CM7,3
Nice app. Works great.,4
"I set it to sync with my contacts it locked my contacts from being edited on my phone. When I logged out my contacts were gone, ones I put on my phone",1
I AM A FAN!,5
"I found a double does of linkedin contacts upon updating. Rather than updating existing contacts, the app creates linkedin specific contacts, so in some cases I had 3 of the same contacts. I do find the app to otherwise be fantastic - great UI, and easily information is easily accesible.",4
Space key on keyboard not working. Hope this is sorted soon. HTC dhd,4
Much harder to get around than old system. don't upgrade if you have not yet,1
The new update renders this app useless. By pass the app and just check on things with computer or browser.,1
not bad.. but very slow as compared to website,2
Please remove / make contact sync configurable. Uninstalled for now.,1
Version 2 is a great application compared with the earlier versions. Many new features and better interface.,4
Sad recent ui. Too poor. Earlier must be rolled back to,1
Previous version of the app was great. V2.0 is a huge step back in every possible way - a rollback would be more than welcome.,1
Very poor. Roll back to first version please,1
Sorry the old interface was much better.,1
Just updated application and wish I hadn't. Not very user friendly or visually appealing.,2
However contact sync doesn't sync photos so it's still not great. I don't really use the main app,2
awsum,4
Great app,4
Great app!,5
Great new UI,5
Why would this app need permission to delete other app's data and change secure system settings? Uninstalling now.,1
Would have been 5 stars but there is no way edit profile or upload a picture,3
Plse provide Move to SD capability!,3
Please add Group functions!!!!,4
It messed up my contact list when it merged LinkedIn with my contact. Many contacts listed 4 times. I deleted them in my phone deleted in Gmail,1
"When attempting to access ""you"" or contacts app hangs on ""loading"" - now working",4
Latest update just made this a five star app,4
"As with many other comments, I don't like the new version. The old version was much simpler, new one is just cluttered.",1
This new version will not let you send invitations. It is buggy. Hope they fix it soon.,2
I can't Sing in through this version!,1
Liked the old version better. New one is messy and not useful,1
Good enough :),4
Gives access to your account but can't move the app to SD. Takes to much space.,3
Forces close every time I attempt to open uninstall.:( Samsung Galaxy,3
Old version looked a lot better. The new one is just cluttered.,2
The new version won't let you send invitations to contacts. Not very useful.,1
Want to connect to other professional then you need this app to help you. Jobs find you!!!!,5
What a backwards step! New interface is cluttered. The news bar is irritating.,2
"it insists my log in details are incorrect, when they are not. Very frustrating.",1
"Backward step with new user interface. Why not ""keep it simple""?",1
Come on......you guys can do better than this.....,1
Large file size at over 2.5mb and can't move to SD card. Shame really as have had to uninstall,2
"The old interface was just fine, this is confusing, cluttered and just less intuitive... Disappointed",1
This new version is super!,5
Keeps giving error message unavailable try back later...been 3 days tried deleting and reinstalled still not working right on HTC EVO,1
Works for me,4
Am not able to add people I find using the app.,3
"Don't like the new UI. Also, need to be able to do things like edit my profile.",2
DOESN'T work...installed and it won't open to do anything,1
HTC Desire HD - Just says that it is loading after I log on... Service unavailable... I'm shocked that it doesn't work since It's LinkedIn.,1
Very much slow.... Takes lots of time to load....,1
does not finish loading any of my data,1
"Latest update is great, better than other official social network apps",5
Application as such ok. But missing possibility to move to SD card . Taking too much memory. Uninstalled.,3
retardedly tedious to log out of app. Uninstalled.,1
Sucks,1
So much better than previous versions and other mobile phone versions of app. Can finally read discussions in groups,4
New layout is horrible. Bring back the old app.,1
it's worse than the old one....,1
HATE the new update/layout!!! So hard to look at and find things. I loved the old version!,1
Awesome app,5
This feels much nicer than before. Breaks the tradition of how a social app should look like,4
"Thinks there are no discussions in some of my Groups, when there are several. So more work needed in Groups support. Otherwise, very nice.",3
"The new release 2.0 is far better than the old version. Faster, better UI, more features... missing push notifications, and real sharing",4
Need to UI attractive,3
Good job,5
Ok app - needs to be transferable to SD card storage,4
Yikes... Talk about losing focus on your target audience. New layout belongs on a dodgy dating site.,1
Quick and easy to use. Great app!,5
"Still quite slow and flaky on the Galaxy S, but much improved yet clumsy UI. Keep getting unintended taps. Ap freezes regularly for extended periods.",3
"Can't trust, Going to uninstall just for that reason.",1
"It really gets me linked in with my friends. HAHA, get it linked in. LOL",5
"It lacks most of what makes the other social networking apps ""for Android"" great.",4
Really disappointed in the new version. Seems more focused on news then LinkedIn. App consistently freezes on my Captivate.,2
One of the best looking and well designed apps in the market. Clean and nice UI.,5
